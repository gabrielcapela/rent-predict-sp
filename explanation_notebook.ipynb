The YData Profiling library will be used for automated exploratory data analysis, and PyCaret, which allows for rapid testing of different regression models, preprocessing, and selection of the best approach based on performance metrics. This strategy allows for the focus of efforts on delivering a usable end product, with significant productivity gains.\n",
